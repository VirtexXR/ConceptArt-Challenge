## Getting Started

## The Problem

We have two environments (Plaza and Lounge) and need to connect the two areas with a liminal space. We do not have any concept art for this area and need you to help extrapolate the style of the two environments into an area that naturally connects the two.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take an existing style and extrapolate that concept effectively into a undefined space. This is also intended as an opportunity for you to showcase your ability to take a vague brief and adapt it into an interesting/engaging space.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 2 days.
